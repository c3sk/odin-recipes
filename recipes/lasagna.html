    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, 
        rich meat or vegetable fillings, and creamy sauces like béchamel. Traditionally, 
        it includes a meat ragu, béchamel sauce, and grated cheese, all baked to a golden, 
        bubbly perfection.
    </p>
    <p>Versatile and customizable, lasagna can be adapted with various ingredients such as 
        roasted vegetables or seafood. It is typically served hot, offering a comforting 
        and hearty meal, often paired with a simple green salad and a glass of red wine.
